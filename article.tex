\startenvironment article

% Specification %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This environment defines following equivalents to LaTeX
% commands:
% 
% \title, \author, \date, \and, \maketitle
%
% In order to setup page encoding, fonts et al. you should
% refer to the Context documentation. Examples:
% 
% \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} becomes \enableregime[utf8]
% \usepackage[german]{babel} becomes \mainlanguage[de]
% Paper size: \setuppapersize[A4][A4]
%
% Some warnings:
% * The package does not have a good algorithm to lay out
%   the list of authors.
% ! Spacings etc. are not perfect and may be changed every
%   now and then to fit LaTeX more!
% * The BibTeX module expects bibliographies to be in the file
%   bibliography.bib. You can override these settings.
%
% Idiomatic Context:
% * This environment is by no means complete. Even if in doubt
%   you should do it the Context way. Compatibility to LaTeX
%   is not the main goal here but to emulate the simplicity
%   of LaTeX to create papers etc is indeed.
% * indenting the first line of a paragraph is done explicitly
%   via \indent
% * quoting is done via \startquote and \stopquote or
%   \startquotation and \stopquotation. Keyfeature: You get the
%   language specific quotation signs for free.
